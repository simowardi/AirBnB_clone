AirBnB clone - The console

# Description
This project is part of the AirBnB clone project,
which aims to create a command-line interpreter CLI to manage AirBnB objects.
The CLI provides users with a text-based interface,
to interact with the system,
allowing them to perform various tasks and operations such as creating,
updating, and deleting objects such as Users, States, Cities, and Places.

This serves as a crucial foundation for the subsequent
development of a full-fledged web application.

# Command Interpreter

The command interpreter, also known as the console or shell,
is a program that allows users to interact with
the AirBnB system using text-based commands.
It provides a command-line interface where users
can input commands to perform specific tasks or operations on AirBnB objects.

# How To Run The Command Line Interpreter
To start the AirBnB clone command interpreter, Run the command `./console.py` .

# Using the Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running,
you can use various commands to manage AirBnB objects.
The available commands include.

create: Create a new object.

show: Display details of a specific object.

destroy: Delete a specified object.

all: List all available objects.

update: Update attributes of a specified object.
